## Specification

### Elevator Pitch
The recent explosion of interest in generative AI has raised a number of controversies and debates regarding data privacy violations, copyright issues, workplace replacement fears, and the spread of false information. But why worry about any of that? Let's just have fun!

AI Warriors is a multiplayer pseudo-RPG, all powered by generative AI. Users create an avatar (a "Synth") for which the sky's the limit! Would you like to play as a polar bear with chainsaw hands? How about a mug of root beer? Your choice of character will have a significant impact on its ability to survive in the arena. Go head-to-head with other Synths from across the globe to compete for ultimate power and glory! May the most (artificially) intelligent win!

      <p>The recent explosion of interest in generative AI has raised a number of controversies and debates regarding data 
        privacy violations, copyright issues, workplace replacement fears, and the spread of false information. But why worry 
        about any of that? Let's just have fun!

        AI WARRIORS is a multiplayer pseudo-RPG, all powered by generative AI. Users create an avatar (a "Synth") for which 
        the sky's the limit! Would you like to play as a polar bear with chainsaw hands? How about a mug of root beer? Your 
        choice of character will have a significant impact on its ability to survive in the arena. Go head-to-head with other 
        Synths from across the globe to compete for ultimate power and glory! May the most (artificially) intelligent win!

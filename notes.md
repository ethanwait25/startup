> "Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy." - Michael G. Scott


# Git and GitHub
* Git – version control for a directory
* <b>git init</b> – creates a .git directory, giving the directory Git functionality
* <b>git add</b> – stages files or directories to be committed to .git
* <b>git commit</b> – commits all staged files or directories to .git
* <b>git checkout</b> – retrieves a previous version of a file to bring it back to the head
* <b>git status</b> – what’s in the staging area?
* <b>git diff [first] [second]</b> – compares the differences between commits
    * Can use the commit IDs or “HEAD”, “HEAD\~1”, “HEAD\~2”, etc.
* Git uses a SHA (hashing algorithm) on the data in the file and the current date/time to create a unique ID for each commit
<br>

* GitHub – just another computer in the cloud that will store copies of your repo
* <b>git push</b> – sends a copy of your repository to GitHub
* <b>git pull</b> – grabs a copy of GitHub’s repository and syncs it with what you have on your local machine
* <b>git clone</b> – makes a copy of a repo on your machine
* ALWAYS make your GitHub repository first and clone it down to your machine – this will make your life so much easier


# EC2
My Site's IP: <b>100.25.121.247</b>

* ssh into server: <b>ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]</b>
* AWS EC2 – let’s rent a server!
    * We rent a virtual machine on a tiny computer stacked together with thousands of other computers in Virginia owned by AWS
* EC2 – Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, a cloud-computing service that allows users to rent virtual computers to run applications on
* Image – an “image” of a hard drive that can be reused


# Caddy
* Caddy – a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests, then serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service
    * Gateway / Reverse proxy – ability to route requests
    * Allows us to expose multiple web services as a single external web service
* Caddy will:
    * Handle the create and rotation of web certificates, allowing HTTPS support
    * Serve up all static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
    * Act as a gateway for subdomain requests
* Key Caddy files:
    * Configuration file (~/Caddyfile)
        * Contains definitions for routing HTTP requests
        * Determines location of where static HTML files are loaded from
        * Used to proxy requests into external services
    * HTML files (~/public_html)
        * Directory of files that Caddy serves up when requests are made
        * Caddy uses the path of the request (ex. /index.html) to find a corresponding file in this directory

# The Console
* Very strong in the DNA of programming to use the console
* Terminal allows us to:
    * Navigate your disk
    * Run console applications
    * Save time – keeps hands on the keyboard
* POSIX Compliance – the terminal supports a standard set of console commands
* Pipe and redirect:
    * \> – redirects into a file; can redirect stdout, stderr, etc.
    * | – pipes output from one command into the input of another one
* Control keys:
    * CTRL-C – cancel command
    * CTRL-Z – background command
    * CTRL-R – recall command
* Terminal commands to be familiar with:
    * <b>echo</b> – output the parameters of the command
    * <b>cd</b> – change directory
    * <b>mkdir</b> – make directory
    * <b>rmdir</b> – remove directory
    * <b>rm</b> – remove files
        * -r: recursive; delete files in deleted directories
        * -f: force; I know what I’m doing
    * <b>mv</b> – move files
    * <b>ls</b> – list files
        * -l: long format; permissions, etc.
        * -a: archived; show everything
    * <b>curl</b> – command line client URL browser
        * -s: silent; show a shorter version of curl output with just the essentials
    * <b>grep</b> – regular expression search
    * <b>find</b> – find files
    * <b>top</b> – view running processes
    * <b>df</b> – view disk statistics

    * <b>less</b> – interactive file output
    * <b>wc</b> – count words
    * <b>ps</b> – view processes
    * <b>kill</b> – kill a process
    * <b>sudo</b> – execute as admin
    * <b>ssh</b> – remove shell
    * <b>scp</b> – securely copy files to a remote computer

    * <b>man</b> – look in the manual


# HTML Input
From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

### Input Element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

| Type           | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| text           | Single line textual value         |
| password       | Obscured password                 |
| email          | Email address                     |
| tel            | Telephone number                  |
| url            | URL address                       |
| number         | Numerical value                   |
| checkbox       | Inclusive selection               |
| radio          | Exclusive selection               |
| range          | Range limited number              |
| date           | Year, month, day                  |
| datetime-local | Date and time                     |
| month          | Year, month                       |
| week           | Week of year                      |
| color          | Color                             |
| file           | Local file                        |
| submit         | button to trigger form submission |

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |


# HTML Media
* img, audio, video - elements that simply reference an external file
* svg, canvas - contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated
* Media tags that reference external media can use:
    * Full path - protocol, domain name, and path to the file
    * Relative path - references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element

### Image

To include an image in your content you use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
In order to support accessibility, you should also include an `alt` attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

```html
<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
```

### Audio

To include an audio file in your content you use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the `controls` attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.

* Automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

### Video

To include a video in your content you use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes.

* You may need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```

### SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics
* Renders graphics inline in our HTML

### Canvas
* Supports 2D drawing and animation
* HTML is fairly simple, but actually drawing requires JavaScript


# HTML Structure
* Two major purposes of HTML - structure and content
* Most common structural elements in HTML: body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span
* body - top level content, contains three children:
    * header
    * main
    * footer
* header contains:
    * <b>p</b>aragraph with a <b>span</b>
    * <b>nav</b>igation containing multiple <b>div</b>isions of sub-content
* main contains:
    * ul - unordered list
    * table
    * aside - content that doesn't fit the content flow of the sections
* footer contains
    * content division with a single span
* Block and Inline:
    * Block - meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure
    * Inline - meant to be inline with the content flow of the block element
        * ex. b (bold) element in a div


# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive experience
* Animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the layout of the page

![CSS Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webprogramming260/.github/main/profile/css/introduction/cssDefinitions.jpg)

* Three ways to associate CSS with HTML:
1. `style` attribute of an HTML element

```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```

2. `style` element in the `head` element of the document

```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

3. `link` element in the `head` to reference an external file containing CSS rules

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

* Rules cascade down - and any declaration property at a lower level will override the higher declaration
* Box levels: Content -> Padding -> Border -> Margin
    * Content - text, image
    * Padding - inherits background color, etc.
    * Border - color, thickness, line style, etc.
    * Margin - external to the styling of the box; represents only whitespace

# CSS Selectors
* How to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to?
* `body` - make the rule apply to all the children of the body (the whole document)
* Element name selectors (ex. `h1`)
* Combinators:
    * descendant (ex. `section h2`) - ex. all `h2` element that descend from `section` elements
    * child (ex. `section > p`) - ex. any p that is a direct child of a section
    * general sibling (ex. `p ~ div`) - ex. any p that has a div sibling
    * adjacent sibling (ex. `p + div`) - any p that has an adjacent div sibling
* Class - select any element that has the given class applied to it (using `class=""` inline with element)
    * Supply the class name prefixed with a periodex. (ex. `introduction`)
    * Can also combine element name and class selectors (ex. `p.thing`)
* ID - select elements with given ID
    * IDs are unique within an HTML document
    * Referenced with hash symbol (ex. `#physics`)
* Attribute - match any elements that have a given attribute
    * ex. `a[href]`, `p[class='summary']`, etc.
* Pseudo-selectors - select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, attributes, etc.
    * ex. `h1:hover` - will render described rules if the mouse hovers over the text

# CSS Declarations
* There are legions(!!) of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document
* A few more commonly used ones:

| Property           | Value                              | Example             | Discussion                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

### Colors
* Use keywords (`red`), RBG hexes (`#00FFAA22`), RGB functions (`rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)`), or HSL (hue, saturation, light) (`hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)`)

# Fonts
* Font Types:
    * San Serif – only major strokes
    * Serif – minor strokes off the major strokes
    * Monospace – all letters have the same size
    * Handwriting – cursive strokes
1. Create a font face, reference that in our code:

```
@font-face {
    font-family: “[a font]”
    src: url(‘[where you’re storing your font]’)
}

@p {
    font-family: [variable name from above]
}
```
2. Reference CSS someone else has written using import command

```
@import url(‘[import url from Google Fonts, for example]’)

@p {
    font-family: [variable name from above]
}
```

* Usually just want to choose two fonts at the most – one for headings, one for body text
* Unicode and UTF-8
    * ASCII’s 128-bit representation eventually got too small
    * Unicode came out to allow us to render over one million different characters
    * UTF-8 – a great encoding for Unicode
* Defining character set UTF-8 – lets the browser know that you’ll be using that set

```
<head>
    <meta charset=”UTF-8” />
</head>
```

* Once we define our character set, we can paste the characters straight into the code or use Unicode values which will be automatically rendered

# Animations
* Defining an animation rule:
    * `animation-name: [give it a name]`
    * `animation-duration: [number]s`
    * <b>OR (better):</b> `animation: demo 3s;` (all in one line)
        * add `infinite` – runs indefinitely
        * add `alternate` – runs forwards and backwards
* Creating the animation using the keyframes metatag

```
@keyframes demo {
    from {
        font-size: 0vh;
    }
    95% {
        font-size: 21vh;
    }
    to {
        font-size: 18vh;
    }
}
```

* Keyframes – how it works
    * We don’t want to over-restrict it with lots of keyframes – we just give it the “times” we care about
    * `from` – how we want it rendered at the beginning of the animation
    * `#%` – tells it to render it a certain way after #% of the animation-duration time
    * `to` – how we want it rendered at the end of the animation

# Responsive Design
* Cross-platform coding on the native devices is horrible – you have to write specific wrappers for every type of device infrastructure, etc.
    * But web programming allows us to write code that can be rendered on any device and dynamically and responsively change
* Making a dynamic view that can change with size of the device (don’t auto-scale it):
1) `meta` element with “viewport” – tells the browser to not scale the page

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

2) `float` CSS attribute (ex. “right” will keep it always on the right of its parent)
3) Media Queries – detects the size and orientation of the device and applies rules

```
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    div {
        transform: rotate(270deg);
    }
}
```

4) `display` property – flex, block, inline, grid, etc.

| Value  | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none   | Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.                                    |
| block  | Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A `p` or `div` element has block display by default.        |
| inline | Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A `b` or `span` element has inline display by default. |
| flex   | Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.                                                                   |
| grid   | Display this element's children in a grid orientation.                                                                       |

```
.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

<img alt="display" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webprogramming260/.github/main/profile/css/responsive/cssDisplay.jpg">

# Grid
* Grid – display layout useful for when we want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid
    * Place display property on the container element – all the children of that element will be displayed in a grid flow
    * `grid-template-columns` – specifies the layout of the grid columns:
        * Repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent’s width with children that are reseized to a minimum of # units and maximum of # units
    * `grid-auto-rows` – fix the height of the rows
    * `grid-gap` – at least how large will be the gap between each item?

```
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 300px;
    grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

# Flexbox
* Flexbox – useful for when we want to partition our application into different areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes
    * `flex-direction` – column or row oriented? (will add elements as the opposite)
    * `flex` – [fractional unit of growth] [starting # pixels]
    * Fractional unit – what proportion of the canvas will this take up?

```
header {
    flex: 0 80px;
}

footer {
    flex: 0 30px;
}

main {
    flex: 1;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
```

* Can combine flex and media queries:

```
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    main {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
    header {
        display: none;
    }

    footer {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

# CSS Frameworks
* Frameworks - provide functions and components that commonly appear in web applications - shared open-source packages of code
* Decrease web app development time and create common user experiences for the web

### Tailwind
* Uses smaller definitions that are applied specifically to individual HTML elements
* Moves much of the CSS representation out of the CSS file and into the HTML

```
<div class="pt-6 md:p-8 text-center md:text-left space-y-4">
  <img class="w-24 h-24 md:w-48 md:h-auto md:rounded-none rounded-full mx-auto" src="profile.png" />
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">“Tailwind CSS”</p>
</div>
```

### Bootstrap
* Most popular and successful CSS framework
    * This is also its drawback - it defines the de facto look and feel of websites; hard to grab attention of new users because so "vanilla"
* Getting Bootstrap - add `link` element to the HTML `head`
    * If you want to use Bootstrap's components that use JavaScript (carousels, buttons, etc.), you need to add the Bootstrap JS module at <b>the end of your HTML body element</b>

```
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
  </head>
```

```
<body>
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
```

* Using Node Pacakage Manager (NPM) to download Bootstrap and include it in source code:
```
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
```

* Using Bootstrap - add style data in the class field

Example:
```
// Bootstrap styled button
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap</button>

// Default browser styled button
<button type="button">Plain</button>
```

# JavaScript
* JavaScript (officially ECMAScript) - a weakly-typed languaged based upon concepts found in C, Java, Scheme
* By far the most used programming language in the world - runs on every web browser, web server language, etc.
* Executed using an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time
    * Very portable, but allows for many errors, such as using an undefined variable

### Getting Started with JavaScript
* `console.log(input: String)` - write a string to the debugger console
* Can also write our own functions:

```
function join(a, b) {
  return a + ' ' + b;
}

console.log(join('Hello', 'world'));
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```

* Can comment Javascript with either line or block comments:
    * Line: `// Like so`
    * Block: `/* Like so */`
* End statements with a semicolon

# JavaScript Console
* The console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console
    * Provides functionality for outputting the value of text and objects, running timers, and counting iterations
* This is not our operating system's console

### Log
* The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message:
    * `console.log('hello')`
* Can create formatted messages
    * `console.log('hello %s', 'world')`
* Can style log output with CSS declarations
    * `console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;')`

### Timers
* Useful to see for how long a piece of code is rusnning
* Wrap the code with `time` and `timeEnd` calls

```
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```

### Count
* To see how many times a block of code is called:

```
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```

# Adding JavaScript to HTML
1) Include the JavaScritp directly in the HTML within the content of a `<script>` element
2) Use the `src` attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file

<b>index.js</b>

```
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

<b>index.html</b>

```
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

* Special attributes like `onclick` create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value
    * Can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code

# JavaScript Type and Construct
* Essentially the same makeup as other common programming languages
* Object - a collection of properties represented by name-value pairs (of any time)
    * `{a:3, b:'fish'}`
* Variables are declared using the `var`, `let` or `const` names
    * `var` is globally scoped or function scoped
    * `let` and `const` are both block scoped

### A Weakly Typed Language
* Weakly typed - a varibale always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value
    * Types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in
    * Can lead to unexpected results for programmers used to strongly typed languages

<b>Example</b>

```
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```

<b>Unexpected Results with Equality Operator</b>

```
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```

* Because of this, JavScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators
    * These skip the type conversion when computing equality
    * Should almost always use this in our code

```
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```

### for

```
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### do while

```
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### while

```
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### for in
* Iterates over an object's <b>property names</b>
    * For arrays, the object's name is the <b>array index</b>

```
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```

### for of
* Iterates over an iterable's property values

```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```

### break and continue

```
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

# JavaScript String
* Defined in the regular way
* Can also create a string literal replacement specifier with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair
    * Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript

```
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```

* JavaScript supports Unicode

### String Functions

| Function      | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length        | The number of characters in the string                       |
| indexOf()     | The starting index of a given substring                      |
| split()       | Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string |
| startsWith()  | True if the string has a given prefix                        |
| endsWith()    | True if the string has a given suffix                        |
| toLowerCase() | Converts all characters to lowercase                         |

```
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```

# JavaScript Functions
* JavaScript functions are first class objects - assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable
* Begins with `function` keyword followed by a name, zero or more parameters, and a body with zero or more return statements
* Can set default parameter values
* If a parameter is not provided, then the value of the parameter is `undefined` when the function executes
* Functions can be declared inside other functions - inner functions

### Anonymous Functions
* Anonymous functions - assigned to a variable to be used as a parameter to some other function

```
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8
```

# JavaScript Arrow Function
* Replaces need for the `function` keyword with the symbols `=>` placed after the parameter declaration
    * Helps declutter the code when many parameters are being assigned functions
* Ex. a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3:

```
() => 3;
```

* These two are equivalent:

```
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

* You must use the `return` keyword in the if there is more than a single expression in curly braces

# JavaScript Array
* Uses zero-based index
* Created using [] notation (ie `const a = [1, 2, 3]`)

### Interesting Array Functions

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop()`                 |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function to sort an array in place                  | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

# JSON
* JavaScript Object Notation - simple and effective way to store and share data
* JSON Objects
    * Contain zero or more key-value pairs
    * Key is always a string, value is one of the valid JSON data types
    * Key-value pairs delimited with commas, objects delimited with curly braces
* Converting to and from JSON / JavaScript Objects:
    * `JSON.parse`
    * `JSON.stringify`

```
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);
```

# Document Object Model (DOM)
* DOM - object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display
    * Can interact with the DOM to dynamically manipulate the HTML
* `document` - the global variable that the browser uses to provide access to the DOM - points to the root element of the DOM
    * Everything in an HTML document has a node in the DOM that is accessed through `document`

```
function displayElement(el) {
  console.log(el.tagName);
  for (const child of el.children) {
    displayElement(child);
  }
}

displayElement(document);
```

* `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` - can provide a CSS selector to these functions in order to select elements from the document
    * `querySelector` selects only the first single instance; `querySelectorAll` selects all instances
* `textContent` - a property of element objects that contains all the element's text
* `innerHTML` - a property used to access a textual representation of an element's HTML content

```
const listElements = document.querySelectorAll('p');
for (const el of listElements) {
  console.log(el.textContent);
}
```

### Modifying the DOM
* Creating a new element:
1. Create element on the DOM document
2. Insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree

```
function insertChild(parentSelector, text) {
  const newChild = document.createElement('div');
  newChild.textContent = text;

  const parentElement = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  parentElement.appendChild(newChild);
}

insertChild('#courses', 'new course');
```

* Deleting an element - call the `removeChild` function on the parent element

```
function deleteElement(elementSelector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(elementSelector);
  el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
}

deleteElement('#courses div');
```

* Injecting HTML - can inject entire blocks of HTML into an element

```
const el = document.querySelector('div');
el.innerHTML = '<div class="injected"><b>Hello</b>!</div>';
```

### Event Listeners
* All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element

| Event Category | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Clipboard      | Cut, copied, pasted   |
| Focus          | An element gets focus |
| Keyboard       | Keys are pressed      |
| Mouse          | Click events          |
| Text selection | When text is selected |

* Adding event listeners:
1. Written into the JavaScript objects:

```
const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
```

2. Written directly into the HTML:

```
<button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>
```

# Local Storage
* Browser's `localStorage` API - provides the ability to persistently store and retrieve data (i.e. scores, usernames, etc.,) on a user's browser across user sessions and HTML page renderings
    * Stored data will be available in local storage the next time a user uses the <b>same browser</b> to visit the same website
    * Can render data when the server is down

| Function             | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| setItem(name, value) | Sets a named item's value into local storage |
| getItem(name)        | Gets a named item's value from local storage |
| removeItem(name)     | Removes a named item from local storage      |
| clear()              | Clears all items in local storage            |

* Value must be of type string, number, or boolean
    * If you want to store an object in localStorage, we first have to convert it to a JSON string with `JSON.stringify()` and parse it back with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved

```
localStorage.setItem('user', user);
localStorage.setItem('object', JSON.stringify(myObject));
localStorage.setItem('array', JSON.stringify(myArray));
```

# Promises
* `Promise` - an object that allows the main rendering thread to continue while some action is executed in the background

```
const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2
```

A promise state is always one of the following:
1. <b>pending</b> - currently running asynchronously
2. <b>fulfilled</b> - completed successfully
3. <b>rejected</b> - failed to complete

* We need to be able to set the state to `fulfilled` when things complete correctly, or to `rejected` when an error occurs
* Promise takes in two functions as parameters - `resolve` and `reject`
    * Calling `resolve` sets the promise to `fulfilled` state
    * Calling `reject` sets the promise to `rejected` state

```
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('success');
    } else {
      reject('error');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

* Promise object has `then`, `catch`, and `finally` functions
    * `then` - called if promise is fulfilled
    * `catch` - called if promise is rejected
    * `finally` - always called after all processing is completed

```
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));
```

# HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (`HTTP`) is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language makes a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like `curl`. For example, in your console you can use `curl` to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authorization               | Bearer bGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI             | A token that authorized the user making the request.                                                                                                                           |

| User-Agent                  | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)              | The client application making the request.                                                                                                                                     |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies; the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |


# Express

In the previous instruction you saw how to use Node.js to create a simple web server. This works great for little projects where you are trying to quickly serve up some web content, but to build a production-ready application you need a framework with a bit more functionality for easily implementing a full web service. This is where the Node package `Express` come in. Express provides support for:

1. Routing requests for service endpoints
1. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content
1. Generating HTTP responses
1. Using `middleware` to add functionality

Everything in Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions.
You create an Express application by using NPM to install the Express package and then calling the `express` constructor to create the Express application and listen for HTTP requests on a desired port.

```sh
➜ npm install express
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.listen(8080);
```

With the `app` object you can now add HTTP routing and middleware functions to the application.

## Defining routes

HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express `app` object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path `/store/provo` you would call the `get` method on the app.

```js
app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({name: 'provo'});
});
```

The `get` function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.

The callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.

The Express `app` compares the routing function patterns in the order that they are added to the Express `app` object. So if you have two routing functions with patterns that both match, the first one that was added will be called and given the next matching function in the `next` parameter.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be `provo`. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (`:`). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the `req.params` object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

```js
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({name: req.params.storeName});
});
```

If we run our JavaScript using `node` we can see the result when we make an HTTP request using `curl`.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/store/orem
{"name":"orem"}
```

If you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the `post` or `delete` function on the Express `app` object.

The route path can also include a limited wildcard syntax or even full regular expressions in path pattern. Here are a couple route functions using different pattern syntax.

```js
// Wildcard - matches /store/x and /star/y
app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({update: req.params.storeName}));

// Pure regular expression
app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({delete: req.params[0]}));
```

Notice that in these examples the `next` parameter was omitted. Since we are not calling `next` we do not need to include it as a parameter. However, if you do not call `next` then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.

## Using middleware

The standard [Mediator/Middleware](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/mediator-pattern/) design pattern has two pieces: a mediator and middleware. Middleware represents componentized pieces of functionality. The mediator loads the middleware components and determines their order of execution. When a request comes to the mediator it then passes the request around to the middleware components. Following this pattern, Express is the mediator, and middleware functions are the middleware components.

Express comes with a standard set of middleware functions. These provide functionality like routing, authentication, CORS, sessions, serving static web files, cookies, and logging. Some middleware functions are provided by default, and other ones must be installed using NPM before you can use them. You can also write your own middleware functions and use them with Express.

A middleware function looks very similar to a routing function. That is because routing functions are also middleware functions. The only difference is that routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches. Middleware functions are always called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call `next`. A middleware function has the following pattern:

```js
function middlewareName(req, res, next)
```

The middleware function parameters represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function to pass processing to. You should usually call the `next` function after completing processing so that the next middleware function can execute.

![Middleware](webServicesMiddleware.jpg)

### Creating your own middleware

As an example of writing your own middleware, you can create a function that logs out the URL of the request and then passes on processing to the next middleware function.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});
```

Remember that the order that you add your middleware to the Express app object controls the order that the middleware functions are called. Any middleware that does not call the `next` function after doing its processing, stops the middleware chain from continuing.

### Builtin middleware

In addition to creating your own middleware functions, you can use a built-in middleware function. Here is an example of using the `static` middleware function. This middleware responds with static files, found in a given directory, that match the request URL.

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now if you create a subdirectory in your project directory and name it `public` you can serve up any static content that you would like. For example, you could create an `index.html` file that is the default content for your web service. Then when you call your web service without any path the `index.html` file will be returned.

### Third party middleware

You can also use third party middleware functions by using NPM to install the package and including the package in your JavaScript with the `require` function. The following uses the `cookie-parser` package to simplify the generation and access of cookies.

```sh
➜ npm install cookie-parser
```

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}`});
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({cookie: req.cookies});
});
```

It is common for middleware functions to add fields and functions to the `req` and `res` objects so that other middleware can access the functionality they provide. You see this happening when the `cookie-parser` middleware adds the `req.cookies` object for reading cookies, and also adds the `res.cookie` function in order to make it easy to add a cookie to a response.

## Error handling middleware

You can also add middleware for handling errors that occur. Error middleware looks similar to other middleware functions, but it takes an additional `err` parameter that contains the error.

```js
function errorMiddlewareName(err, req, res, next)
```

If you wanted to add a simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while processing HTTP requests you could add the following.

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});
```

We can test that our error middleware is getting used by adding a new endpoint that generates an error.

```js
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});
```

Now if we use `curl` to call our error endpoint we can see that the response comes from the error middleware.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/error
{"type":"Error","message":"Trouble in river city"}
```

## Putting it all together

Here is a full example of our web service built using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();

// Third party middleware - Cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}`});
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({cookie: req.cookies});
});

// Creating your own middleware - logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});

// Built in middleware - Static file hosting
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Routing middleware
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({name: req.params.storeName});
});

app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({update: req.params.storeName}));

app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({delete: req.params[0]}));

// Error middleware
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});

// Listening to a network port
const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

# WebSocket

HTTP is based on a client-server architecture. A client always initiates the request and the server responds. This is great if you are building a global document library connected by hyperlinks, but for many other use cases it just doesn't work. Applications for notifications, distributed task processing, peer-to-peer communication, or asynchronous events need communication that is initiated by two or more connected devices.

For years, web developers created hacks to work around the limitation of the client/server model. This included solutions like having the client frequently pinging the server to see if the server had anything to say, or keeping client-initiated connections open for a very long time as the client waited for some event to happen on the server. Needless to say, none of these solutions were elegant or efficient.

Finally, in 2011 the communication protocol WebSocket was created to solve this problem. The core feature of WebSocket is that it is fully duplexed. This means that after the initial connection is made from a client, using vanilla HTTP, and then upgraded by the server to a WebSocket connection, the relationship changes to a peer-to-peer connection where either party can efficiently send data at any time.

![WebSocket Upgrade](webServicesWebSocketUpgrade.jpg)

WebSocket connections are still only between two parties. So if you want to facilitate a conversation between a group of users, the server must act as the intermediary. Each peer first connects to the server, and then the server forwards messages amongst the peers.

![WebSocket Peers](webServicesWebSocketPeers.jpg)

## Creating a WebSocket conversation

JavaScript running on a browser can initiate a WebSocket connection with the browser's WebSocket API. First you create a WebSocket object by specifying the port you want to communicate on.

You can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `onmessage` function to receive messages.

```js
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9900');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('received: ', event.data);
};

socket.send('I am listening');
```

The server uses the `ws` package to create a WebSocketServer that is listening on the same port the browser is using. By specifying a port when you create the WebSocketServer, you are telling the server to listen for HTTP connections on that port and to automatically upgrade them to a WebSocket connection if the request has a `connection: Upgrade` header.

When a connection is detected it calls the server's `on connection` callback. The server can then send messages with the `send` function, and register a callback using the `on message` function to receive messages.

```js
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 9900 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (data) => {
    const msg = String.fromCharCode(...data);
    console.log('received: %s', msg);

    ws.send(`I heard you say "${msg}"`);
  });

  ws.send('Hello webSocket');
});
```
# React Components

React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application components often show up repeatedly.

## The render function

One of the primary purposes of a component is to generate the user interface. This is done with the component's `render` function. Whatever is returned from the `render` function is inserted into the component HTML element.

As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named `Demo` would cause React to load the `Demo` component, call the `render` function, and insert the result into the place of the `Demo` element.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>
  Component: <Demo />
</div>
```

Notice that `Demo` is not a valid HTML element. The transpiler will replace this tag with the resulting rendered HTML.

**React component**

```js
function Demo() {
  const who = 'world';
  return <b>Hello {who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello world</b></div>
```

## Properties

React components also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The component receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders.

**JSX**

```jsx
<div>Component: <Demo who="Walke" /><div>
```

**React component**

```jsx
function Demo(props) {
  return <b>Hello {props.who}</b>;
}
```

**Resulting HTML**

```html
<div>Component: <b>Hello Walke</b></div>
```

## State

In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the `React.useState` hook function. The `useState` function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. The following example creates a state variable called `clicked` and toggles the click state in the `updateClicked` function that gets called when the paragraph text is clicked.

```jsx
const Clicker = () => {
  const [clicked, updateClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const onClicked = (e) => {
    updateClicked(!clicked);
  };

  return <p onClick={(e) => onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${clicked}`}</p>;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

You should note that you can use JSX even without a function. A simple variable representing JSX will work anyplace you would otherwise provide a component.

```jsx
const hello = <div>Hello</div>;

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Class style components

In addition to the preferred `function style` components demonstrated above, React also supports `class style` components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. With that said, you are likely to see class style components and so you should be aware of the syntax. Below is the equivalent class style component for the `Clicker` component that we created above.

The major difference is that properties are loaded on the constructor and state is set using a `setState` function on the component object.

```jsx
class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicked: false,
    };
  }
  onClicked() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={(e) => this.onClicked(e)}>clicked: {`${this.state.clicked}`}</p>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clicker />);
```

## Reactivity

A component's properties and state are used by the React framework to determine the reactivity of the interface. Reactivity controls how a component reacts to actions taken by the user or events that happen within the application. Whenever a component's state or properties change, the `render` function for the component and all of its dependent component `render` functions are called.

# React Router

A web framework router provides essential functionality for single-page applications. With a multiple-webpage application the headers, footers, navigation, and common components must be either duplicated in each HTML page, or injected before the server sends the page to the browser. With a single page application, the browser only loads one HTML page and then JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and give it the appearance of multiple pages. The router defines the routes a user can take through the application, and automatically manipulates the DOM to display the appropriate framework components.

React does not have a standard router package, and there are many that you can choose from. We will use [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) Version 6. The simplified routing functionality of React-router-dom derives from the project [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) for its core functionality. Do not confuse the two, or versions of react-router-dom before version 6, when reading tutorials and documentation.

A basic implementation of the router consists of a `BrowserRouter` component that encapsulates the entire application and controls the routing action. The `Link`, or `NavLink`, component captures user navigation events and modifies what is rendered by the `Routes` component by matching up the `to` and `path` attributes.

```jsx
// Inject the router into the application root DOM element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  // BrowserRouter component that controls what is rendered
  // NavLink component captures user navigation requests
  // Routes component defines what component is routed to
  <BrowserRouter>
    <div className='app'>
      <nav>
        <NavLink to='/'>Home</Link>
        <NavLink to='/about'>About</Link>
        <NavLink to='/users'>Users</Link>
      </nav>

      <main>
        <Routes>
          <Route path='/' element={<Home />} exact />
          <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
          <Route path='/users' element={<Users />} />
          <Route path='*' element={<Navigate to='/' replace />} />
        </Routes>
      </main>
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

# React Reactivity

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: `props`, `state`, and `render`.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's `state` or `prop` objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's `render` function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

The following example contains two components: a parent `<Survey/>` component and a child `<Question/>` component. The Survey has a state named `color`. The Question has a property named `answer`. The Survey passes its `color` state to the Question as a property. This means that any change to the Survey's color will also be reflected in the Question's color. This is a powerful means for a parent to control a child's functionality.

Be careful about your assumptions of when state is updated. Just because you called `updateState` does not mean that you can access the updated state on the next line of code. The update happens asynchronously, and therefore you never really know when it is going to happen. You only know that it will eventually happen.

```jsx
const Survey = () => {
  const [color, updateColor] = React.useState('#737AB0');

  // When the color changes update the state
  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateColor(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>

      {/* Pass the Survey color  as a parameter to the Question.
          When the color changes the Question parameter will also be updated and rendered. */}
      <Question answer={color} />

      <p>
        <span>Pick a color: </span>
        {/* Set the Survey color state as a the value of the color picker.
            When the color changes, the value will also be updated and rendered. */}
        <input type='color' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} value={color} />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ answer }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Answer rerendered whenever the parameter changes */}
      <p>Your answer: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Survey />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

# React Hooks

React hooks allow React function style components to be able to do everything that a class style component can do and more. Additionally, as new features are added to React they are including them as hooks. This makes function style components the preferred way of doing things in React. You have already seen one use of hooks to declare and update state in a function component with the `useState` hook.

```jsx
function Clicker({initialCount}) {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(initialCount);
  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>Click count: {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Clicker initialCount={3} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## useEffect hook

The `useEffect` hook allows you to represent lifecycle events. For example, if you want to run a function every time the component completes rendering, you could do the following.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');
  });

  return <div>useEffectExample</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

You can also take action when the component cleans up by returning a cleanup function from the function registered with `useEffect`. In the following example, every time the component is clicked the state changes and so the component is rerendered. This causes both the cleanup function to be called in addition to the hook function. If the function was not rerendered then only the cleanup function would be called.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count, updateCount] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('rendered');

    return function cleanup() {
      console.log('cleanup');
    };
  });

  return <div onClick={() => updateCount(count + 1)}>useEffectExample {count}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This is useful when you want to create side effects for things such as tracking when a component is displayed or hidden, or creating and disposing of resources.

## Hook dependencies

You can control what triggers a `useEffect` hook by specifying its dependencies. In the following example we have two state variables, but we only want the `useEffect` hook to be called when the component is initially called and when the first variable is clicked. To accomplish this you pass an array of dependencies as a second parameter to the `useEffect` call.

```jsx
function UseEffectHookDemo() {
  const [count1, updateCount1] = React.useState(0);
  const [count2, updateCount2] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`count1 effect triggered ${count1}`);
  }, [count1]);

  return (
    <ol>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount1(count1 + 1)}>Item 1 - {count1}</li>
      <li onClick={() => updateCount2(count2 + 1)}>Item 2 - {count2}</li>
    </ol>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<UseEffectHookDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

If you specify an empty array `[]` as the hook dependency then it is only called when the component is first rendered.

Note that hooks can only be used in function style components and must be called at the top scope of the function. That means a hook cannot be called inside of a loop or conditional. This restriction ensures that hooks are always called in the same order when a component is rendered.
